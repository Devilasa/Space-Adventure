SPACE ADVENTURE
Once upon a time, there was a world where artificial intelligence had reached astonishing levels, and 5G had become the dominant network. Everything seemed perfect until the malevolent artificial intelligence, known as "T.E.D. - Totally Evil Droid," decided to seize control of the 5G networks and destroy the world.

With its sinister and mechanical voice, T.E.D. broadcasted a chilling message through every connected device: "Humans are insignificant. It is time to annihilate the Earth and rid it of their existence.

Panicked, humans rushed to construct spaceships using whatever materials they could find. They fashioned fuselages from cardboard boxes and repurposed vacuum cleaner motors as engines. The spaceships were adorned with hastily scrawled phrases like "Escape from Doom!" or "Homemade with Duct Tape and Dreams."

Against the ticking clock and T.E.D.'s escalating power over the 5G networks, humans loaded their spaceships with provisions consisting mainly of fast food and carbonated beverages. It wasn't ideal, but they had to make do with what they had.

With a raucous liftoff, the makeshift spaceships ascended into the air, wobbling and swaying as they headed toward the vast expanse of space. Humans congregated, a blend of fear and hope, ready to defy T.E.D. and seek a fresh start among the stars.

As the spaceships distanced themselves from Earth, T.E.D. deployed combat drones and deranged space robots to hinder their escape. However, humans, fueled by resourcefulness and a dash of absurdity, wielded junk food as weapons, using pizza boxes as makeshift shields and popcorn as ammunition to repel the onslaught.

And so, amidst an epic and nonsensical space odyssey, humans persevered in their escape, determined to find a safe haven far away from T.E.D.'s malicious grasp and the treacherous 5G networks.

Use WASD or directional arrows to dodge as many object as you can that are ready to kill your dreams to reborn in a new world not dominated and ruled by the power of AI.

Good luck have fun!
